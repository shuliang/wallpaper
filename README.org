This experimental project downloads photo from [[https://unsplash.com][unsplash]] and set wallpaper for your Mac,
it's mainly inspired by and mimics [[https://itunes.apple.com/cn/app/unsplash-wallpapers/id1284863847?l=en&mt=12][Unsplash Wallpaper]] with some minor differences:

- Download photo to =~/Pictures/Wallpapers/= other than =~/Download/=.
- Auto open download photo.
- +Set wallpaper only for currrent desktop.+\\
  [[https://itunes.apple.com/cn/app/unsplash-wallpapers/id1284863847?l=en&mt=12][Unsplash Wallpaper]] introduced the same feature at =Version 1.1= on =02 June 2018=.

* How to use
** download app directly
You can download the zip file [[https://github.com/shuliang/wallpaper/releases][here]], unzip and run it.

** build from source
Clone this project, open =Wallpaper.xcodeproj= with Xcode and press =âŒ˜+R=.
It'll just run, no third party libs, no =Cocoapods= or =Carthage= configurations,
friendly for beginners.

It's originally written with =Swift4.1=, built with =Xcode 9.4=, deployment targeted at
=macOS 10.11=, tested with macOS High Sierra (=10.13.5=). If you run into any trouble,
please file an [[https://github.com/shuliang/wallpaper/issues][issue]].

At present, =wallpaper= is a demo app which is limitd to =50 requests= per hour to
unsplash regulation, so it may fail when loading photos. For better user experience,
I recommand you to apply for your own *Access Key* on [[https://unsplash.com/oauth/applications][Unsplash]], replace current
=CLIENT_ID= in =WallpaperManager.swift= and rebuild this project.

* Todo
- [ ] apply for unsplash production permission
- [ ] install from Homebrew
- [ ] preferences page
- [ ] auto change wallpaper periodically
- [ ] launch on system startup

* Thanks
The [[https://itunes.apple.com/cn/app/unsplash-wallpapers/id1284863847?l=en&mt=12][Unsplash Wallpaper]] is really awesome, but it can only set
wallpaper for all desktops (version 1.1 can set wallpaper separately),
this's inconvenient and gives me the idea to write this demo.

Thanks [[https://unsplash.com][unsplash]] and all creators of those *breathtaking* photos.
